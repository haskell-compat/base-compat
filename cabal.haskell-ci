-- Old versions of Haddock have trouble building the documentation for
-- base-compat-batteries' Data.Type.Equality.Compat module:
--
-- * GHC 7.2.2 runs into "synifyType: PredTys are not, in themselves, source-level types."
--   This bug is apparently so obscure that no issue was ever filed about it!
--
-- * GHC 7.6 runs into https://github.com/haskell/haddock/issues/242
haddock:        <7.2.2 || (>=7.4.1 && <7.6.1) || >=7.8.1
