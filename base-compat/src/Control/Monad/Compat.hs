{- | The 'foldM' function is analogous to 'foldl', except that its result is
encapsulated in a monad. Note that 'foldM' works from left-to-right over
the list arguments. This could be an issue where @('>>')@ and the `folded
function' are not commutative.

>       do
>         a2 <- f a1 x1
>         a3 <- f a2 x2
>         ...
>         f am xm

If right-to-left evaluation is required, the input list should be reversed.

Note: 'foldM' is the same as 'foldlM'
